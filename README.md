# Robot Rights
## A Curriculum Informed by Western and Eastern Principles

With the rise of social robotics and assistive AI, the debate over robot rights is becoming increasingly important. What are robot rights? How should we navigate the complex landscape of human and robot rights from moral, legal, and social perspectives? As AI competition increases between East and West, can we bridge the growing divide by achieving a shared framework of robot rights applicable in cross-cultural settings?   


We present a robot rights curriculum in which we construct and work through a foundational framework to engage in critical thinking, understanding, and discussion of decisions regarding robot rights. We cultivate an understanding of the robot rights debate informed by Western and Eastern principles as a step toward uniting our global community. Through the study of robot rights motivated by both Western and Eastern principles, we take an important first step toward addressing existing gaps in knowledge and discourse on robot rights.
